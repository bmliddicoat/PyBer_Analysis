# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
As a new data analyst hire of Pyber (ride share company), I have been tasked to develop data visualization that will help stakeholders in the future of the business.  The three keys market areas in question are types of cities being served by the company are urban, suburban, and rural.  Areas that will be investigated include fares for each market, riders in coordinating market and total drivers in the market.  By using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib, a detailed analysis will occur and a development of associated graphs.  The first analyzation covered included scatterplot of Pyber Ride Sharing (2019), summary statistics (number of rides by city, fare by city, number of drivers), percentage of total fares by each city, percentage of total rides by city type, and percentage of total drivers by city type.  After these initial analyzations, V. Isualize has asked for further investigation of the data.  The expectations are a creation of summary DataFrame of the riding sharing data by city type and creation of a multiple-line graph that shows total weekly fares for each market (city type).  These finding will assist stakeholders in determining which actions may be needed to increase access and affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

There are potential discrepancies within the three markets. One area to investigate is the percentage of total drivers by city type compared to percentage of total rides by city type.  The urban city type accounts for 68.4 of all total rides but has 80.9% of total drivers.  Well, the suburban area had 26.3% of total rides and 16.5% of total drivers.  Rural city types had 5.3% of total rides and 2.6% of drivers.  There seems to be an "overserving" of urban market and "underserving" of the suburban and rural markets.  Rural market is least underserved market.  This has effects on pricing for the consumer with rates increasing.  The average fare per ride for each city type and average fare per driver help expose this issue.  Urban city average fare for ride is $24.53 and average far per driver at $16.57.  Suburban average fare per ride is $30.47 and average fare per driver $39.50.  Rural average fare per ride is $34.62 and $55.49 fare per driver.  

When examining these stark differences between the markets, it can be expected that customers using the services and drivers may become less satisfied.  One area to address is the drivers.  The urban area has oversaturated total of drivers (1625 total rides compared to 2405 total drivers).  Rural (125 rides to 78 total drivers) and suburban (625 total rides to 490 drivers) are being underserved.  Pyber may need to reach out drivers to express there is more potential in earnings if they would drive within the suburban and rural markets.  The average fare per driver in these city types is over double fare in suburban city type and over triple in rural areas.  This could promote accessibility for customers using Pyber and as well get driver satisfaction due to potential increase in earnings.  Next area would be the difference within the suburban and rural total rides versus urban rides.  Pyber may want to have marketing within these city types to promote the service.  This could increase usage and further incentivizes drivers to these markets.  Population may be lower within the city types of rural and suburban areas, population growth within these areas could cause further discrepancies.  Drivers must also be contacted and encouraged these areas.  Lastly, further data analysis into the markets should be completed.  Areas to investigate would include distance traveled, peak times within city types, and demographics.  These data analyzations could help discover underserved populations, trends causing increase in fare per ride/fare per driver, and marketing strategies to grow Pyber.
